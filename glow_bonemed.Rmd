From the age vs bmi and fracscore vs age scatter plots there doesn't seem to be any groupings or separations between fracture yes/no categorical response.

As age increases the average bmi decreases
There is a strong positive correlation between age and fracscore

```{r}
ggplot(glow_bonemed, aes(x = age, y = bmi, color = fracture)) +
  geom_jitter()
```
